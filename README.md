# Wine-quality-prediction Лаба 1
Objectives:

 The objectives of this project are as follows
1.	To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
2.	To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

By the use of several Machine learning models, i will predict the quality of the wine, according to it's features.
For this project, we are using winequality_data to determie the speciifique quality of different wine using machine learning
